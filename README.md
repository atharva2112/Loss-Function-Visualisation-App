# Loss-Function-Visualisation-App
# Interactive Optimization Algorithms Demonstrator

## Project Description
This project is an interactive web application built with Dash and Plotly in Python. It allows users to visualize the process of optimizing a user-defined quadratic function using four different optimization algorithms: Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, and Gradient Descent with Line Search.

## Features
- **User-defined quadratic function**: Users can enter values for the parameters of the quadratic function to define its shape.
- **Choice of optimization algorithm**: Users can choose from four different optimization algorithms to minimize the quadratic function.
- **Interactive visualization**: The results are visualized as a contour plot of the quadratic function with markers showing the steps taken by the optimization algorithm towards a local minimum.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script in your local environment.
2. Open the web application in your browser.
3. Enter values for the parameters of the quadratic function.
4. Choose an optimization algorithm.
5. Click on the contour plot to start the optimization process and visualize the results.

## Educational Tool
This project serves as an educational tool for understanding how different optimization algorithms work. It provides a hands-on, interactive way to explore these concepts and see them in action.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Plotly

Enjoy exploring optimization algorithms!
